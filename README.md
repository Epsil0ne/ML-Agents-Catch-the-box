# ML-Agents-Catch-the-box

https://epsi.itch.io/ai-job-catch-the-box-


The main purpose of this application is to show the result of hour-long training of little agents trying to learn to catch a box.

This learning is made throught the machine learning tool provided by Unity3D and there were some unexpected results throught my numerous training (my first agent was scared as hell and another one catch the box in the laziest way possible).

The application has 3 parts: 

1) You can watch the various agent in their training environment

2) You can watch agent playing together

3) You can play against agents by trying to catch them or escape them
